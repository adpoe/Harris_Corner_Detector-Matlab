# Harris Corner Detection and SIFT Feature Classification

## Notes
- Harris Corner Detection Algorithm is found in 'extract_keypoints.m', keypoints are extracted based on 'cornerness'
- SIFT Feature Classification is found in 'compute_features.m'
- A script to run both algorithms on 10 separate image files is found in 'show_keypoints.m'
    * The show keypoints script will BOTH show AND save each of the 10 files.
- The 10 images used can be found in the /images folder.
    * Please move them to correct path location in order to run them through your Matlab install.
- My outputs from the Harris Corner Detector algorithm are saved in the /outputs folder, so you can see expected outputs.
